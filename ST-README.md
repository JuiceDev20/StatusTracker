#StatusTracker


 Status Tracker is a Web-based software application designed to mirror any of a wide variety of bug tracking
 software systems in use by corporations throughout world. If a company develops software, whether for in-house
 use or distribution, it uses a bug tracking system to maintain an accurate record of the software development process
 on a per-project basis.
 
 Status Tracker is built as a Web-based service application using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, MVC architecture,
 MS Code-First database schema using Entity Framework with user- and role-level security, and web pages built with HTML4,
 Twitter Bootstrap, and model binding with Razor.
 
 Status Tracker is commercial-grade and performs to professional standards, comparable to similar commercial applications.
 It allows users to sort, filter, search, manage users, and assign tasks.
 
 Status Tracker is fully secured using Authentication and Authorization through Microsoft Entity Framework to prevent
 unauthorized persons from accessing user profile and account information.
